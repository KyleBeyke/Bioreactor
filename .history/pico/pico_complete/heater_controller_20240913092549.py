# heater_controller.py

"""
HeaterController manages the control of an AC heater using PID control and zero-cross detection.
The controller ensures that the duty cycle does not exceed a defined maximum (adjustable via commands)
and uses phase-delay switching to control the heater's power.

Dependencies:
- digitalio: For controlling the heater's GPIO pin.
- countio: For counting zero-cross events in the AC signal.
- asyncio: For managing asynchronous tasks (such as zero-cross handling).
- Logger: For logging important events and errors.
